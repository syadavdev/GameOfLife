<h1>Game of life</h1>

All code related this problem present in one file - GameOfLife

<b>Initialize Grid:</b>
1. Initialize grid universe with Row * Column. - By default all cell all dead.
2. Use the `Glider` pattern placed in the middle of the 25x25 cell universe for demonstration. - For initial alive cell used this hint. 

<b>Transitions:</b> In code these are defined as `Operation`
1. UnderPopulation
2. NextGeneration 
3. Overcrowd
4. Reproduction

<b>Objectives:</b>
1. Implement the game of life data structures and algorithm.<br>
    >Implements all the transition logic by factory design pattern.
2. Demonstrate that game of life algorithm works.<br>
   >Run main function and see the logs for it.

<br>
<p><b>Problem:</b> The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed.<br>
<b>Solution:</b> Apply Executor framework and locking mechanism.</p>
